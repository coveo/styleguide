<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Checkboxes allow multiple selection inside a set of one or more options. They can also be used as an on or off toggles with only one checkbox.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a wording that indicates how much item the user can select. Some user may not know the difference between checkboxes and radio buttons.</li>
    <li>List options vertically; horizontal listings can make it difficult to tell which label is related to which checkbox.</li>
    <li>Try to limit the size of the label to one line.</li>
    <li>Always put the most common options at the top of the list.</li>
    <li>Only preselect options if there’s a strong, user-centred reason to. If you do it, select the value that has the most chance to be chosen by the users.</li>
    <li>Only reveal additional questions with the expanded zone, pointing to the value that is selected.</li>
    <li>Partially selected state is used only to indicate that some sub-options are selected and some are not.</li>
    <li>Use positive statements. Negative language in labels can be counterintuitive. For example, use “I want to receive a promotional email” instead of “I don’t want to receive promotional email.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A set (multiple checkboxes) should have a title.</li>
    <li>Surround a related set with a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>. Do not use <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> for a single checkbox.</li>
    <li>Both the checkbox and its label can be clicked to select the option.</li>
    <li>The control needs a larger hit areas on a touch devices.</li>
</ul>
