    <p class="h3 py1">Inline Validation is direct feedback as the user progress through the form, that help reassure users that their answers are valid. Inline Validation will help people complete forms quickly and with less effort, fewer errors, and more satisfaction. It is opposed to validate all the inputs at the end when the user submit the form.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">It can give many types of feedback: suggestions for valid answers, confirmation that a correct answer was given, and live updates designed to help people stay within necessary limits.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">Inline validation is useful for the answers that aren’t obvious, answers with specific formatting requirements or answers with potentially high error rates (e.g., Name wouldn’t be appropriate for inline validation).</p>
