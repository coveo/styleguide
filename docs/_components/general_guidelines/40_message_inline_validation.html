    <p class="h3 py1">Inline Validation is direct feedback displayed as the user progresses through the form to confirm that their answers are valid. Inline Validation helps people complete forms quickly and with less effort, fewer errors, and more satisfaction. The opposite approche is to validate all the inputs at the end of the process, when the user submits the form.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">It can give many types of feedback: suggestions for valid answers, confirmation that a correct answer was given, and live updates designed to help people stay within necessary limits.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">Inline validation is useful for the answers that are not obvious, answers with specific formatting requirements or answers with potentially high error rates (e.g., Name would not be appropriate for inline validation).</p>
