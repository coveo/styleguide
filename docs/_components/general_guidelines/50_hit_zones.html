<div class="spaced-boxes-container flex flex-wrap">
    <p class="h1 py1 bold text-light-blue">44px x 44px + 10px clearance around hit zones (54px total)</p>

    <p class="h3 py1">Ideally, link and <span class="bold">button hit zones</span> shouldnâ€™t be smaller than <span class="bold">44px x 44px</span>, to make it easy to activate on touch screens with the average human finger size and not require to aim to precisely with a mouse or trackpad, on a computer.</p>

    <p class="h3 py1">If the hit zone <span class="bold">has to be smaller for technical reasons</span>, it is important to make sure that there is a <span class="bold">44px non-clickable space around the hit zone plus a 10px clearance</span> (minimum non-clickable space between 2 hit zones), which makes a <span class="bold">54px x 54px non-clickable space required for any hit zone.</span></p>
