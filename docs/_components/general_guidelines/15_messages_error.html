    <p class="h3 py1">Error messages are used to inform the user that an error happened. They are the most likely to bother your users, because their particularity is that they cannot be dismissed, they must be addressed. There are two types of error messages: errors caused by the user, and errors caused by the system. If you can’t avoid error messages, use them sparingly.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">When an error caused by the user occurs in a form, you must:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Put a prominent top-level error message</h2>
            <p class="h3">Display a banner that summarizes what happened, with links to all input in error (really helpful for screen readers) and how to resolve the existing error. The message can’t be rejected by the user with a close button, it can only disappear when the error is resolved. The banner appears at the top of the form and moves the content below.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Highlight the incorrect input field </h2>
            <p class="h3">The problematic input field should be prominently indicated and should include instructions that invite the user to try another answer. To do that, the label should be red and red instructions should be added below the input field.</p>

        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Display a modal prompt</h2>
            <p class="h3">The prompt is used to grab users’ attention. It must be explained in the message why the error has happened without blaming the user for the error. Give the user indications: contact the support, try again in 10 minutes, reload the page, etc.</p>
