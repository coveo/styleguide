    <p class="h3 py1">Success messages are used to inform that an action took place or that a form was completed successfully. It appears in a green banner at the very top of the screen, over the content. The success message dismiss itself by an animation because it does not require any actions from the user. Contrary to error messages, success messages should never block peopleâ€™s progress, they should encourage the user to continue.</p>
    <p class="h3 py1">When displaying a success message, you must:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Present the success message in context</h2>
            <p class="h3">The success message should be presented in context on the same form that was just completed, so as not to block any further progress.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Avoid success message page dead ends</h2>
            <p class="h3">When the success message is displayed in a process, it can include useful actions related to the task the user just completed. It gives user clear and actionable next steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 class="h2 pt1">Use a Prompt to show a complex success message</h2>
            <p class="h3">Sometimes, success message contains information that people want to keep, like a code or a link to an invitation. In such case, keep this valuable information visible on the screen by using a prompt. The user should be able to copy and paste the information.</p>
